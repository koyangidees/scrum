               <h2>What is <span>SCRUM</span>?</h2>
               <p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for project 
                   management mainly deployed in agile software development. 
                   The scrum methodology emphasizes functional software, the 
                   flexibility to change along with emerging business realities, 
                   communication and collaboration.</p>

                        <h2>Scrum Process Flow</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.</li>
                            <li>During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.</li>
                            <li>The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, while meeting every day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).</li>
                            <li>Along the way, the Scrum Master keeps the team focused on its goal.</li>
                            <li>At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.</li>
                            <li>The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.</li>
                            <li>As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.</li>
                            <li>This goes on until the project is deemed complete, either by stopping to work (deadline, budget, etc.) or by completing the entire wish list.</li>
                        </ol>

                <p class="col-sm-4"><span>Product owners</span> communicate product vision to the development team and represent customer interests via prioritization and requirements.</p>
                <p class="col-sm-4"><span>Scrum masters</span> act as a connection between the product owner and the team. Their main role is to remove any barriers that may prevent the team from achieving its goals. Scrum masters help the team to remain productive and creative.</p>
                <p class="col-sm-4"><span>Scrum teams</span> generally consist of seven cross-functional members. For instance, software projects include software engineers, architects, analysts, programmers, QA experts, UI designers and testers.</p>
